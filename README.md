On the studying page, a stopwatch is available to keep track of how long you have been working for. A pause button is available for anytime a break is needed. On the left, the tasks are displayed. Whenever a task has been finished, it can be checked off and the remaining tasks will move in place to remove any blank spots. Once all the tasks are completed, the user will be congratulated and the total time they studied for will be displayed
